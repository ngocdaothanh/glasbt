* May also be used as a lightweight standalone web server

== Install and use with SBT projects

Download glasbt.zip and extract to a directory and add this directory to system
path, so that the command "glasbt" can be run easily.

$ sbt package         <-- create WAR file
$ glasbt              <-- start GlashFish and deploy the WAR file
